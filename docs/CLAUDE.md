# RouteIQ - Project Goals & Strategic Direction

## Current State (as of Nov 2025)
RouteIQ is positioned as a **data-driven route optimization platform for outdoor running**, with features including:
- OpenStreetMap terrain integration
- Strava API analytics
- Performance predictions
- Weather-optimized route recommendations
- Personalized route discovery

## Strategic Direction Discussion

### Option 1: Maintain Pure Running Focus
**Strengths:**
- Clear, focused value proposition
- Less competition in route optimization niche
- Easier to become THE solution for this specific problem
- Current branding (RouteIQ) perfectly aligned
- Can deeply integrate with running-specific platforms (Strava, Garmin, etc.)

**Challenges:**
- Narrower target market (outdoor runners only)
- Seasonal usage patterns in some regions
- Users who also do gym work need separate apps

### Option 2: Expand to Full Fitness Tracking Platform
**Strengths:**
- Broader market appeal (gym-goers, cross-trainers, etc.)
- Year-round engagement (gym workouts when weather is bad)
- More data = better insights across all fitness activities
- Potential for higher user retention
- Could track progressive overload for strength training
- Machine-specific metrics (weight, reps, sets, rest times)

**Challenges:**
- Extremely crowded market (competing with Hevy, Strong, JEFIT, MyFitnessPal, etc.)
- Requires different feature set and UX paradigms
- Name "RouteIQ" becomes misleading if gym tracking is primary
- Development resources split between two different product visions
- Risk of being "okay" at both vs. "excellent" at one

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Core Identity:** RouteIQ as a running optimization platform with complementary workout tracking

**How it could work:**
- **Primary focus:** Running route optimization (what makes you unique)
- **Secondary feature:** Workout tracking to capture cross-training and strength work
- **Value proposition:** "The only app that understands how your gym work impacts your running performance"

**Implementation approach:**
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Nail the running route optimization
2. **Phase 2:** Add basic workout logging for cross-training
3. **Phase 3:** Build analytics that connect gym performance to running performance
   - "Your leg press improvements correlated with 3% better hill performance"
   - "Recovery runs after heavy squat days show optimal adaptation"

**Why this works:**
- Differentiated positioning (not just another gym tracker)
- Serves runners who strength train (common among serious runners)
- Natural expansion path that builds on core competency
- The data integration creates unique value vs. using separate apps

## My Honest Opinion

I think **you should start with running and add gym tracking strategically**, but here's the catch: your personal motivation matters more than market strategy.

**If gym tracking excites you more:**
- You'll build it better and faster
- You'll understand the pain points deeply
- You'll actually use your own product
- BUT: Consider a rebrand if gym becomes primary (RouteIQ doesn't make sense)

**If running optimization excites you more:**
- Build that first until it's exceptional
- Add gym tracking as a "plus" feature
- Use gym data to make running recommendations smarter

**The real question:** What problem are you more passionate about solving?
1. "Runners keep running the same boring routes and don't optimize for their goals"
2. "Gym-goers need better progressive overload tracking across different machines"

My suggestion: **Build what you'd actually use.** A focused product you're passionate about beats a comprehensive one you're lukewarm on.

## Immediate Next Steps

Decide on one of these paths:

**Path A - Running First (Safer)**
- Complete the running route optimization MVP
- Validate with real users
- Add basic workout tracking in v2 if demand exists

**Path B - Workout First (Follows Your Interest)**
- Pivot to workout tracking as primary feature
- Consider renaming the project
- Add route optimization later as expansion

**Path C - Hybrid from Start (Riskier but Comprehensive)**
- Build both simultaneously
- Risk: slower progress on both fronts
- Requires clear prioritization framework

## Questions to Answer
1. What's your 3-month goal? Ship running optimization or workout tracking?
2. Who's your ideal first user? A runner or a gym-goer?
3. What problem keeps you up at night wanting to solve?
4. Do you run more or go to the gym more? (Use your own behavior as signal)

## My Recommendation
Based on what you've said ("workout tracking is currently more interesting to me"):

1. **Pivot the focus** to workout tracking as the primary feature
2. **Rebrand** to something like "FitIQ" or "GymIQ" or "TrainIQ" (more flexible than RouteIQ)
3. **Keep route optimization as a feature** but not the headline
4. Build what genuinely interests you - that's where innovation happens

OR

1. **Force yourself to focus on running** for the next 8 weeks
2. Ship a minimal but excellent running route optimizer
3. Get feedback from real runners
4. Then decide if you want to add gym tracking or pivot entirely

The worst outcome is building both half-heartedly. Pick one, make it excellent, then expand.

**Last thought:** The gym tracking market is saturated, but the "data-driven workout optimization with predictive analytics" angle is less saturated. If you go the gym route, lean HARD into the "IQ" part - make it smarter than Hevy/Strong, not just another tracker.
